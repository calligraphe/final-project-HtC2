; PROBLEM 1:

; whether or not they are a verified user, and follows some number of people. 
; 
; Design a data definition for Chirper, including a template that is tail recursive and avoids 
; cycles. 
; 
; Then design a function called most-followers which determines which user in a Chirper Network is 
; followed by the most people.

; PROBLEM 2:
; 
; In UBC's version of How to Code, there are often more than 800 students taking 
; the course in any given semester, meaning there are often over 40 Teaching Assistants. 
; 
; Designing a schedule for them by hand is hard work - luckily we've learned enough now to write 
; a program to do it for us! 
; 
; Below are some data definitions for a simplified version of a TA schedule. There are some 
; number of slots that must be filled, each represented by a natural number. Each TA is 
; available for some of these slots, and has a maximum number of shifts they can work. 
; 
; Design a search program that consumes a list of TAs and a list of Slots, and produces one
; valid schedule where each Slot is assigned to a TA, and no TA is working more than their 
; maximum shifts. If no such schedules exist, produce false. 
;
; You should supplement the given check-expects and remember to follow the recipe!
